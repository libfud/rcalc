    let help_help =
"The help function has the form (help term1, term2, term3...) and prints out
examples of how operators are used. You can use help for individual operators
for individual operators, and you can list operators by group with the 
following terms: arithmetic, logic, trigonometry (or trig), and statistics
(or stats). See also (help use). An example of usage is

(+ 2 2)";

    let use_help =
"rcalc is an arbitrary precision polish notation (lisp style) calculator.
It requires that expressions are wrapped in parentheses ( \"( and \") ).
The operator goes first in any expression, followed by its terms.
For an  example, the following returns -3/2:

(/ (- 6 (pow 9 (/ 2)) (+ -4.5 13/2))) ; 2/3

As you can see, you can nest expressions. Not all expressions are evaluated:

(+ 2 (if (> 3 2) (+ 7 3) (* 2))) ; 12

only (> 3 2) and (+ 7 3) are evaluated in that case, and then added to 2.

There are a variety of acceptable input formats for numebers. You can prepend
a negative symbol to the numerator or denominator, use fractions, or numbers
that have a explicit radix (decimal) point. However, mixing explicit radix
points with fractional notation is disallowed, and the preferred method
is either just an integer as a numerator or an explicit fraction. If you
want to express the reciprocal of a number, either input it as 1/n, where n is
a numeric literal, or as (/ n). Input as numbers with an explicit radix 
is quite buggy due to the limitations of IEEE754.";

    let arithmetic_help =
"The arithmetic operators are +, -, *, /, %, and pow.
In general, the arithmetic operators can take 0 terms, or as many terms as you
like. For example, pow acts like a tower of power.

(pow 2 3 4) ; 2417851639229258349412352

is equivalent to (pow 2 81).
To see more help, use help with the appropriate arithmetic operator.
Aadditionally, see (help abs), as I have not classified it yet.";
